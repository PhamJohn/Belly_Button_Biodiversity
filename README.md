# Summary 
This project includes use of Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. 

Three basic plots were created horizontal bar chart, gauge chart, and bubble chart. There were event handlers added for interactivity. Charts are built once a user selects a sample ID number from the drop-down menu options.
